# Shanghai
For Shanghai cohort 4 in Sept/Oct.  

### Randomization
Randomization: 4 groups (40 each)
- T1: No repetition
- T2: Repetition all from SEMC
- T3: Repetition from three sources
- T4: Repetition from three sources + reveal that they are from SEMC

### Test
- Run `test.py` (link [here](https://github.com/lizzij/PowerOfRepetition/blob/master/distribution/chatbot/shanghai/test.py))
  - when prompted, input the day you want to test
  - remember to run `flask init-db` in between tests for different days (to ensure no conflict in db)
